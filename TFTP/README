Questions:
    1. The RRQ and WRQ have a mode string. Carefully explain and document the meaning
    of the mode. Explain how you handle modes in your implementation and carefully
    justify your decision.

    The available modes are "netascii" and "octect", in any combination of upper and 
    lower case characters. 
    Netascii: 
        Netascii is a modified form of ASCII, defined in RFC 764.
        This is an 8-bit version of ascii. 
    Octet:
        Octet allows for the transfer of arbitrary raw 8-bit bytes.
    Mail:
        Netascii characters sent to a user rather than a file.
        This mode is obsolete, and is not implemented and should not be used.

    We handle these modes by first converting the string to lowercase and then checking
    it against "netascii" and/or "octet.

    If the mode is found to be netascii, we read the file with fopen(file, "r"), where the r 
    means we are reading the file as a text file. If the client requests netascii, then the client is 
    requesting a text file so we can simply read the file as a text file, and transmit it to the client in
    that format. 

    If however the mode is octet, we read the file with fopen(file, "rb"), where the rb means 
    we are reading the file as a binary file. The mode octet means that the client wants to download 
    a binary file, we need to read it as a binary so that it can be transmitted to the client in 
    the correct requested format.

    2. Explain how your server handles attempts of uploading files.
    If we get a WRQ we send the client an error packet with error code 2, and the message is 
    "Access violation.".
    Then we wait for the next packet.

    If we get a DATA packet from the client we send an error packet with error code 4, and the message is
    "Illegal TFTP operation.".
